What's the difference between a lecture, a tutorial and a workshop?
A lecture is a formal presentation conducted by your lecturer.

Tutorials are smaller classes which allow discussion of lecture content and assignments. 
You can ask questions and clarify what you have studied.

Workshops usually involve academic staff presenting themes or concepts related to the course. 
Workshops are usually more hands on learning that allow discussion regarding the given topic.
